  * @brief     STM32F103xE Devices vector table for Atollic toolchain.
  *            This module performs:
  *                - Set the initial SP
  *                - Set the initial PC == Reset_Handler,
  *                - Set the vector table entries with the exceptions ISR address
  *                - Configure the clock system   
  *                - Configure external SRAM mounted on STM3210E-EVAL board
  *                  to be used as data memory (optional, to be enabled by user)
  *                - Branches to main in the C library (which eventually
  *                  calls main()).
  *            After Reset the Cortex-M3 processor is in Thread mode,
  *            priority is Privileged, and the Stack is set to Main.
